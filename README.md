# topdung-scripts
summary
these scripts are to be used in unity engine and are made in solution with unity engine. they inherit from monobehaviour script from unity3d and you have to have a project linked in unity for scripts to inherit.
plug gamemanager in an empty GameManager object in unity
  plug your player prefab inside player section
  plug your floating text prefab and floating text
  now you can set objects in-game to send floating text to your floating text manager on collision (such as chests telling you how much gold they gave your character)
this is a WIP(work in progress) project and will be updated often
